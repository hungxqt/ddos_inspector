**ddos_inspector** is a lightweight, real-time DDoS detection and mitigation plugin designed for [Snort 3](https://snort.org/). Unlike traditional static rule-based detection or heavy ML-based systems like SnortML, this plugin combines statistical methods and behavioral profiling to identify and block malicious traffic ‚Äî all with minimal system overhead.

---

## üîç Key Features

- **Statistical Analysis**: Detects anomalies using EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average) and entropy-based methods.
- **Behavioral Profiling**: Flags suspicious behaviors like half-open TCP connections and prolonged HTTP sessions (e.g., slowloris).
- **Real-Time Mitigation**: Integrates with `iptables`/`nftables` to block malicious IPs dynamically.
- **Lightweight**: 
  - CPU usage < 5%
  - RAM usage < 100MB
  - Detection latency < 10ms
- **No ML Frameworks**: Pure C++ implementation without TensorFlow or external ML dependencies.

## üéØ Detection Capabilities

- **SYN Floods**: Detects incomplete TCP handshake attacks.
- **UDP/ICMP Floods**: Handles volumetric attacks with high packet rates.
- **HTTP Floods**: Detects excessive application-layer traffic.
- **Slowloris Attacks**: Identifies persistent, low-volume connections.

---

## üß© Architecture Overview

- `ddos_main.cpp`: Manages packet flow and plugin orchestration.
- `stats_engine.cpp`: Implements EWMA & entropy calculation logic.
- `behavior_tracker.cpp`: Monitors long-lived sessions and TCP anomalies.
- `firewall_action.cpp`: Executes mitigation using `nftables` or `ipset`.

### Data Flow

1. **Pre-Filter**: Removes non-TCP/UDP traffic to reduce processing load.
2. **Statistics Engine**: Computes entropy and packet rates, exports Prometheus metrics.
3. **Behavior Tracker**: Analyzes connection state (e.g., >80 half-open TCP sockets).
4. **Mitigation Engine**: Blocks IPs with high anomaly scores for 10 minutes.
5. **Auto-Recovery**: Periodic re-evaluation unbans clean IPs automatically.

## üß™ Testing & Evaluation

- **Environment**: Tested with Mininet, hping3, Slowloris, and tcpreplay.
- **Metrics**:
  - Detection Precision ‚â• 93%
  - False Positive Rate ‚â§ 3%
  - Detection time < 1s, Block time < 2s

| Attack Type      | Detection Time | Block Time | FPR     |
|------------------|----------------|------------|---------|
| SYN Flood        | <1s            | <2s        | <2%     |
| HTTP Flood       | <1s            | <2s        | <2%     |
| Slowloris        | <5s            | <2s        | <3%     |

## üõ† Installation

```bash
# Prerequisites
sudo apt install snort3 libpcap-dev libboost-all-dev nftables cmake

# Build
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
```

> Place the plugin in Snort's plugin directory and add appropriate `inspector` config in `snort.lua`.
