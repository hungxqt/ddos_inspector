## 3. Gap Identification

### 3.1. Comparison of Efficiency and Precision

To assess the effectiveness of Snort, SnortML, and industry best practices, we compare their performance in detecting DDoS attacks, including sophisticated low-and-slow attacks that pose significant challenges.

#### Snort

- **Efficiency**: Snort, an open-source intrusion detection system (IDS), is highly efficient for detecting known threats due to its rule-based approach. It processes network traffic quickly with low latency, making it ideal for real-time monitoring in environments with predictable attack patterns. However, it struggles with zero-day and low-and-slow DDoS attacks, which often lack clear signatures.
- **Precision**: High for known attack patterns, but can be lower for evolving threats. False positives can occur if rules are not finely tuned. Example: a Poisson distribution model achieved a false positive rate of 0.005%.

#### SnortML

- **Efficiency**: Incorporates machine learning to detect unknown threats. Offers better coverage of zero-day attacks but introduces higher latency due to computational costs. SVM models reported 95.11% accuracy but required ~120 seconds for training.
- **Precision**: High for trained attacks; however, false positives are more likely if models are not well-tuned. False positive rates ranged from 0.008% (SVM) to 0.024% (Bagging).

#### Industry Best Practices

- **Efficiency**: Combines on-prem solutions with cloud-based services like Netscout and Cloudflare. Hybrid setups offer real-time detection with scalable cloud mitigation.
- **Precision**: Achieves high precision using rule-based, anomaly-based, and behavioral analysis. Complexity can lead to false positives if not configured correctly.

#### Table 1: Efficiency and Precision Comparison

| System              | Efficiency                              | Precision                                |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Snort               | High for known threats, low for zero-day | High for known patterns, lower for new   |
| SnortML             | Moderate, higher latency due to ML       | High with training, variable for new     |
| Industry Best Practices | High with hybrid approaches, complex setup | High with multiple methods, complex tuning |

### 3.2. Focus on Detection Latency, Resource Usage, and False Positives

#### Detection Latency

- **Snort**: Low latency due to pattern matching.
- **SnortML**: Higher latency due to real-time ML processing and training overhead.
- **Industry Best Practices**: Varies. Cloud solutions offer low latency; local ML-based systems may be slower.

#### Resource Usage

- **Snort**: Lightweight, works on modest hardware (e.g., i5/i7).
- **SnortML**: High resource consumption due to ML; not ideal for edge devices or constrained environments.
- **Industry Best Practices**: Can be intensive but offloads processing to cloud infrastructure.

#### False Positives

- **Snort**: Low with proper tuning (e.g., 0.005% false positive rate).
- **SnortML**: Higher but depends on training and tuning (0.008% - 0.024%).
- **Industry Best Practices**: Low, though complexity can lead to alerts if not managed.

#### Table 2: Performance Metrics Comparison

| System              | Detection Latency      | Resource Usage | False Positives                     |
|---------------------|------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Snort               | Low                    | Low            | Low if tuned                        |
| SnortML             | Moderate to High       | High           | Moderate, training-dependent        |
| Industry Best Practices | Varies (Low in cloud) | High           | Low with tuning                     |
